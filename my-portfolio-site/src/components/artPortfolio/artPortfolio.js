                        <h1>My Art</h1>
                        <p>I am an individual with many different skills and interests. One of these skills that I have been practicing all my life is art. I really enjoy building logos and here are a few of the ones I have created recently. The first Is my own logo for this website. The second is a logo I have created for a fellow engineer for her app known as <span onClick={onClickFetch}>Fetch!</span>. Click on the fetch logo or the highlighted word to see the site. My main tools I use for creating logos are contained in Adobe Creative Suite. This skill has been incredibly useful for my software engineering designs. My art skills are still something i continue to practice and I currently am working on more logos for other software engineers.</p>
